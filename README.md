# My Developer Portfolio

This is the updated repo for my personal website: [chriswray.dev](https://chriswray.dev). I will be refactoring the codebase to use Strapi 4 with Nuxt 3 and have merged the backend and frontend to exist in the same repo for better maintainability and testing.

Each application will have better documentation at their root directory readme's.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- Node/ JavaScript
- Strapi CMS v4 (upgrade in progress)

### Frontend

- JavaScript/ Vue 3 (upgrade in progress)
- Nuxt 3 (upgrade in progress)
- Tailwind CSS
